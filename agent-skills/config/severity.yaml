# Gopher Guides — Configurable Rule Severity Levels
#
# Teams can override this file to customize which rules are critical vs warning vs suggestion.
# Skills reference these severity mappings when generating reports.
#
# Severity levels:
#   critical  — Must fix before merge. Blocks CI.
#   warning   — Should fix. Flagged in reviews.
#   suggestion — Nice to have. Informational only.
#
